Much amusement this morning. Did Alexa do what I asked? No, but it did what was needed for a bloody good giggle!

T was doing an lateral flow test.<br />
What I said: Blow your nose before you do it<br />
What Alexa heard and did:<br />

![Alexa heard: "would you play nice before you do it"]({{ "images/2022-01-15-nice-Song.png" | relative_url }})

To replicate; if you have an Alexa ask - "play nice before you do it".  Warning contains explicit language!

Update:

I found the song on Deezer, for those that need to know.
